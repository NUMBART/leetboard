# Leetboard

While participating in codeforces contests I liked the friends leaderboard feature a lot. With existing leetcode related tools you can view the rank of a single user at a time, and none of them are for ongoing contests.

I created this site for making it possible to create and view friend leaderboards for a live contest. Will add other features like problem ratings, live contest rating changes, global rating leaderboard with country/organisation filters, if a few users end up using this regularly. Do leave a star if you like this site.

## How to use

1. Access the site here - https://leetboard.herokuapp.com/

2. Select the type of leaderboard you would like to view.

3. For friends leaderboard, type the username of your friend(case sensitive) and hit enter to add him to friend list.
