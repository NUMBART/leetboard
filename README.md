# Leetboard

While participating in codeforces contests I liked the friends leaderboard feature a lot. With existing websites you can view the rank of a single user at a time, and none of them are for ongoing contests.

I created this site for making it possible to create and view friend leaderboards for a live contest. Will add other features like problem ratings, live contest rating changes, global rating leaderboard - country/organisation here if you find this current version useful.
